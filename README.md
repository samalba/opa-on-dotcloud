OPA on dotCloud!
================

    git clone git://github.com/samalba/opa-on-dotcloud.git
    dotcloud create myapp
    dotcloud push myapp opa-on-dotcloud

The repos contains an __app.opa__ example code. You can compile any OPA
source code.

__The first push is slow__ (several minutes) because OPA compiler is being
installed. Further pushes are faster.
